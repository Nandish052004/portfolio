  <h2>1. Business Case</h2>
  <p>GE Healthcare, a global leader in medical technology and diagnostics, faced the challenge of developing and deploying AI-based medical imaging solutions at scale. Their existing infrastructure, though functional, lacked the speed, scalability, and flexibility required for modern AI workflows. They needed a platform that could support rapid experimentation, high-performance computing, and streamlined deployment while adhering to healthcare industry standards for security and compliance <a class="ref" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ge-healthcare/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>
  <p>Medical imaging, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays, generate vast volumes of complex data. Manually analyzing this data is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. GE Healthcare wanted to automate this process using AI models capable of detecting anomalies, classifying scans, and segmenting critical regions, such as tumors or organs <a class="ref" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ge-healthcare/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>
  <p>By leveraging AWSâ€™s cloud-based infrastructure and AI services, GE Healthcare was able to build a robust and scalable platform for end-to-end machine learning (ML). AWS enabled them to securely store medical images, run training jobs at scale, automate labeling tasks, and deploy models globallyâ€”all while ensuring compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR <a class="ref" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ge-healthcare/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>
  <p>This case study demonstrates how AWS services like Amazon SageMaker, S3, and Ground Truth were integrated to streamline the lifecycle of medical imaging AIâ€”from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, inference, and deliveryâ€”making healthcare more intelligent and accessible <a class="ref" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ge-healthcare/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3>
  <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image-related tasks. In the context of GE Healthcare, CNNs are used to process and analyze medical scans such as X-rays and MRIs. CNNs work by applying convolutional filters that slide over the input image to capture features like edges, textures, and patterns <a class="ref" href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.</p>
  <img src="images/cnn.jpeg" alt="Funny animation" width="400" style="margin-right: 100px;">  <img src="images/cnn2.jpeg" alt="Funny animation" width="400">
  <p>CNNs enhance the system by eliminating the need for manual feature extraction. Unlike traditional ML models that require hand-crafted features, CNNs learn what to extract directly from the raw data <a class="ref" href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ U-Net for Image Segmentation</h3>
  <p>U-Net is a specialized CNN architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation. Unlike classification models that predict a label for an entire image, segmentation models assign a label to each pixel <a class="ref" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>
  <img src="images/unet2 copy.png" alt="Funny animation" width="400" style="margin-right: 100px;">
  <p>U-Net follows an encoder-decoder structure: the encoder compresses the image to learn context, while the decoder reconstructs it to match the original resolution, producing a segmented output. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers preserve spatial details <a class="ref" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>
  <img src="images/CNN_alias_Unet.jpeg" alt="Funny animation" width="400" style="margin-right: 100px;">

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Sagemaker Pipelines (DAG-based)</h3>
  <p>AWS SageMaker Pipelines enable building and automating ML workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Each stepâ€”data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deploymentâ€”is a node in the graph <a class="ref" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines.html" target="_blank">[4]</a>.</p>
  <p>In GE Healthcare's workflow, raw images are stored in Amazon S3 and passed through a labeling stage using Ground Truth. The labeled data is preprocessed and sent to SageMaker for training CNN or U-Net models <a class="ref" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines.html" target="_blank">[4]</a>.</p>
  <img src="images/sagemaker copy.jpeg" alt="Funny animation" width="400" style="margin-right: 100px;">
  <h3>ðŸ’¡ Inference Code Example</h3>
  <pre><code>import boto3

runtime = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')

response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(
    EndpointName='gehealthcare-xray-model',
    ContentType='application/x-image',
    Body=open('patient_scan.jpg', 'rb').read()
)

print(response['Body'].read())</code></pre>
