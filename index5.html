    <h1>Discovery+ Personalization with Amazon Personalize</h1>
    <p><strong>Portfolio Case Study | AI/ML on AWS | Streaming Personalization</strong></p>
  </header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Business Case</h2>
    <p>Discovery+, a leading entertainment and streaming company, aimed to offer a seamless and deeply personalized viewing experience to its diverse user base. Facing fierce competition from global streaming giants, the company set an ambitious goal: to enhance viewer engagement and retention by providing smart content recommendations tailored to individual preferences. This objective demanded advanced machine learning capabilities and scalable infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provided Discovery+ with a powerful suite of tools and services to achieve this transformation. Using Amazon Personalize‚Äîa fully managed ML service‚Äîthe company was able to build real-time recommendation engines without needing extensive ML expertise. AWS helped Discovery+ simplify its infrastructure, accelerate its time to deployment, and most importantly, improve the quality and personalization of content delivery for millions of users globally.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>By integrating AWS Personalize into its platform, Discovery+ moved away from static, rule-based systems toward dynamic models that learn from user behavior. This shift not only improved user satisfaction but also contributed to key business metrics like click-through rate (CTR), watch time, and content discovery effectiveness. These improvements align perfectly with Discovery+'s goal of delivering intuitive, engaging, and relevant entertainment to its audience across genres, devices, and regions.</p>

  <h2>2. Algorithms & Data Structures </h2>
  <p>
    The core intelligence behind Discovery+‚Äôs recommendation engine lies in a combination of machine learning algorithms and efficient data structures. These help understand what the user likes, predict future preferences, and serve relevant content instantly. Let‚Äôs break down each component:
  </p>
  <img src="images/Collaborative_Filtering_in_Recommender_Systems.jpg" alt="Funny animation" width="400">  
  <h3>üîπ Collaborative Filtering</h3>
  <p>
    This is the heart of modern recommendation systems. The idea is simple: if two users watched similar shows before, they might enjoy similar shows in the future. It uses a <strong>user-item interaction matrix</strong> (like a giant Excel sheet) where rows are users, columns are items (videos), and cells record interactions (like a rating or watch event).
  </p>
  <img src="images/Collaborative_filtering.gif" alt="Funny animation" width="400">  
  <ul>
    <li>Example: If User A and User B both watched Shows X and Y, and User A also watched Show Z, then User B might like Show Z too.</li>
    <li>This matrix is usually very sparse (most people don‚Äôt watch everything), so we need techniques like matrix factorization (explained next) to make sense of it.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- <p><em>Source:</em> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/matrix-factorization-for-recommendation-systems-c3c3e4f7d35f" target="_blank">Matrix Factorization - TowardsDataScience</a></p> -->


  <h3>üîπ Matrix Factorization</h3>
  <p>
    Since the user-item matrix is sparse (mostly empty), we "compress" it into two smaller matrices using a technique called matrix factorization. One matrix represents user preferences, and the other represents item features.<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Imagine we're saying: ‚ÄúUser 123 likes thrillers, documentaries, and romantic comedies.‚Äù These preferences become a vector: [0.9, 0.4, 0.7]</li>
    <li>Each movie also has a vector: Movie A = [0.8, 0.2, 0.6]</li>
    <li>We compute similarity by multiplying these vectors (dot product). Higher the score, more relevant the movie.</li>
    <li>Amazon Personalize does this using deep matrix factorization under the hood, so you don‚Äôt need to build it manually!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Reference:</em> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/matrix-factorization-for-recommendation-systems-c3c3e4f7d35f" target="_blank">Matrix Factorization - TowardsDataScience</a></p>


  <h3>üîπ Nearest Neighbor Search (k-NN)</h3>
  <p>
    When new users or items are added (cold start problem), we can‚Äôt use past data. Here, <strong>k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)</strong> algorithms come to the rescue:
  <a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We represent users or items as vectors in a high-dimensional space (like a cloud of dots).</li>
    <li>We measure similarity using <strong>cosine similarity</strong> or <strong>Euclidean distance</strong>.</li>
    <li>Example: If a user just watched a nature documentary, we recommend another similar documentary by finding the closest dot (nearest neighbor) in vector space.</li>
    <li>Efficient search is done using structures like <strong>KD-Trees</strong> or <strong>Ball Trees</strong> to avoid scanning the entire space.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Reference:</em> <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html" target="_blank">Nearest Neighbor Search - scikit-learn</a></p>


  <h3>üîπ Ranking Algorithms (Learn-to-Rank)</h3>
  <p>
    It's not enough to know what the user might like‚Äîwe also need to rank content in order of relevance. This is where ranking algorithms come in.
  <a href="#ref4">[4]</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking):</strong> Assumes users prefer certain items over others based on implicit signals like watch time, skips, or likes.</li>
    <li><strong>LambdaRank:</strong> Focuses on adjusting the order of results so that more relevant items come on top based on user behavior.</li>
    <li>Amazon Personalize uses these under the hood and evaluates using metrics like <strong>Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</strong>‚Äîhigher score = better ranking.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Reference:</em> <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/bpr" target="_blank">Bayesian Personalized Ranking - PapersWithCode</a></p>
  

  <h3>üî∏ Summary: Why These Algorithms Work Together</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering:</strong> Captures behavior-based patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Matrix Factorization:</strong> Compresses data, learns hidden traits.</li>
    <li><strong>k-NN:</strong> Helps with new users/items.</li>
    <li><strong>Ranking:</strong> Makes top recommendations more relevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß† Backend Data Structures Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sparse Matrices:</strong> Used to represent user-item interactions compactly.</li>
    <li><strong>Hash Maps / Dictionaries:</strong> Used for real-time session-based interaction logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Vectors & Embeddings:</strong> Used to place users/items in a space for similarity computations.</li>
    <li><strong>KD-Trees/Ball Trees:</strong> Fast search of similar users/items in multi-dimensional space.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üí° Real Amazon Personalize Runtime API Usage</h3>
  <p>This Python snippet shows how Discovery+ would fetch recommendations using Amazon Personalize‚Äôs API:</p>
  <pre><code>import boto3

# Create runtime client
runtime = boto3.client('personalize-runtime')

# Request recommendations for a user
response = runtime.get_recommendations(
  campaignArn='arn:aws:personalize:region:account-id:campaign/DiscoveryCampaign',
  userId='user123'
)

# Print top item recommendations
for item in response['itemList']:
  print("Recommended Item ID:", item['itemId'])</code></pre>

  <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><p>
    Internally, this fetches recommendations based on the user‚Äôs historical interactions. The logic (matrix factorization, collaborative filtering, etc.) is abstracted away, but this gives you real-time results with low latency.

    <h2>3. Models & Figures</h2>
    <p>The architecture used by Discovery+ demonstrates how cloud-native services simplify AI/ML deployment:</p>
    <img src="images/casestudy1 copy.png" alt="Funny animation" width="400">  
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Users interact with the app, which triggers an AWS Lambda function. This function calls the Amazon Personalize API to get real-time, personalized content. The training data is periodically updated from Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.</p>
    <p>ML models are trained automatically on historical interaction logs. Amazon Personalize manages model retraining, evaluation, and deployment seamlessly.</p>
