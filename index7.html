    <h2>1. Business Case</h2>
    <p>Walmart, one of the largest global retail chains, faces the critical challenge of maintaining real-time inventory updates across thousands of stores and millions of SKUs. Manual systems or traditional relational databases often fail under the pressure of high transaction volume and real-time demand fluctuations, leading to issues like stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient logistics.</p>
    <p>To address these challenges, Walmart adopted a cloud-native solution using AWS infrastructure—leveraging services like Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SQS. This scalable setup ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and low-latency performance for inventory operations. Behind the scenes, a key data structure powering this system is the Fenwick Tree (also known as Binary Indexed Tree), which efficiently handles range sum queries and updates in logarithmic time.</p>
    <p>By integrating this advanced data structure with AWS services, Walmart ensures that stock levels are constantly updated and queried across warehouses and e-commerce platforms. This alignment of algorithmic efficiency with cloud scalability significantly enhances supply chain operations and customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p>This case study explores how Walmart utilizes this structure in real-world deployments, demonstrating the power of DSA-backed cloud solutions in optimizing business-critical functions like inventory control.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>2. Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
    <p>The Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) is a highly efficient data structure used to perform cumulative frequency queries and updates in O(log n) time. It is particularly useful in scenarios where large datasets need to support frequent updates and range queries—a perfect fit for Walmart's real-time inventory use case.</p>
    <p>Imagine a scenario where Walmart has to quickly compute how many units of a product were sold across various locations in the last 24 hours or update stock levels after a flash sale. Instead of recalculating totals every time, a Fenwick Tree allows fast prefix sum computation and incremental updates, ensuring operations remain efficient even as data size scales. For example, with an array representing inventory levels over different stores, a Fenwick Tree allows querying total inventory between two stores or updating the stock of a specific store without recalculating the entire array.</p>
    <p>The implementation involves storing partial sums in a tree-like structure backed by an array. Updates propagate only to affected nodes using bitwise operations, which minimizes overhead. Fenwick Trees are ideal when range sum queries and single-point updates need to be processed frequently and concurrently—critical in retail systems with rapid order placements and returns.<a href="#ref2">[1]</a></p>
    <p>In Walmart’s architecture, the Fenwick Tree logic is implemented in a backend Lambda function triggered by stock updates. DynamoDB stores the tree nodes persistently, ensuring consistency. Amazon SQS queues are used to manage burst traffic without data loss. The combination of algorithmic efficiency and cloud resilience enables an always-on inventory system.</p>

    <h2>3. Models & Figures</h2>
    <p>The following architecture diagram explains how the real-time inventory management works at scale within Walmart using AWS services:</p>
    <img src="images/casestudy3 Diagram copy.png" alt="Funny animation" width="400" style="margin-right: 100px;">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a customer purchases an item or returns a product, the transaction is published to an Amazon SQS queue. A Lambda function reads these messages, updates the Fenwick Tree structure stored in DynamoDB, and adjusts the relevant inventory levels. This setup ensures updates are non-blocking, distributed, and scalable across regions. The read operations use the same tree logic to retrieve range queries like "total inventory in warehouses 5 to 10."<a href="#ref3">[2]</a></p>

    <h2>4. Efficiency Analysis</h2>
    <p>Before adopting this optimized cloud-algorithm fusion, Walmart faced high latency in data updates and querying. Traditional SQL-based inventory systems became bottlenecks as the volume of real-time transactions increased. Here's how the new system improves key metrics:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Before (Legacy)</th>
        <th>After (AWS + Fenwick Tree)</th>
        <th>Detailed Reason</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Inventory Update Latency</td>
        <td>2-5 seconds</td>
        <td>&lt; 150ms</td>
        <td>Optimized O(log n) operations via Fenwick Tree reduce processing time. AWS Lambda ensures fast, serverless execution.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Query Performance</td>
        <td>Full table scans</td>
        <td>Indexed O(log n) queries</td>
        <td>Range queries are processed using tree node traversal instead of full scans. DynamoDB provides indexed access.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Scalability</td>
        <td>Limited by SQL clusters</td>
        <td>Global with autoscaling</td>
        <td>AWS scales compute (Lambda), storage (DynamoDB), and messaging (SQS) horizontally with traffic.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>System Downtime</td>
        <td>Manual recovery needed</td>
        <td>High availability</td>
        <td>AWS built-in fault tolerance ensures service continuity even if nodes or regions fail.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This setup not only improves response time and accuracy but also ensures that Walmart’s digital and physical shelves stay in sync—even during flash sales or seasonal peaks.</p>

    <h2>5. Story, References & Connection</h2>
    <p>Inventory inaccuracies can cost retailers millions. In Walmart’s case, transitioning to a system that blends real-time data structures with cloud-native services has redefined retail efficiency. The journey involved experimenting with several data structures before identifying the Fenwick Tree as the best fit for their access/update patterns. With AWS, they automated everything—triggering updates with SQS, computing deltas with Lambda, and storing snapshots in DynamoDB.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional approaches that decouple physical and online inventories, Walmart's unified system ensures consistency across supply chain endpoints. This avoids the common issue of overselling or understocking. The decision to use AWS was not just about tools—it was about achieving agility, resilience, and scalability.</p>
    <p>By combining algorithmic insights from computer science and the robust infrastructure of AWS, Walmart set a new benchmark in inventory optimization. It demonstrates that knowing the right data structure isn’t just an academic exercise—it’s central to solving real-world enterprise problems efficiently.</p>

    <h2>6. Inference</h2>
    <p>The Walmart inventory case study illustrates how traditional computer science concepts like Fenwick Trees can be harnessed in modern cloud infrastructures to solve massive real-time business challenges. The collaboration between data structures and serverless AWS services shows a clear example of theoretical knowledge delivering real value.</p>
    <p>Looking forward, such systems could be extended using AWS IoT for warehouse sensors, machine learning to predict demand surges, or edge computing to process events locally. The potential is vast, and it all starts with the right algorithm backed by the right platform.</p>
