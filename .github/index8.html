  <p><strong>Amazon Robotics ‚Äì Smart Warehouse Navigation with Graph Algorithms and AWS IoT</strong></p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>1. Business Case</h2>
  <p>Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers serve as the heart of its global e-commerce operations, handling millions of products that are ordered and shipped daily. To ensure rapid delivery and accurate inventory management, Amazon employs hundreds of thousands of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), originally developed by Kiva Systems, now known as Amazon Robotics <a class="ref" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-robots-help-amazon-ship-packages-on-time" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>

  <p>These robots automate repetitive warehouse tasks such as locating and transporting inventory shelves to human operators for order picking. This drastically reduces the amount of walking employees need to do, boosting operational speed and lowering labor fatigue. Instead of people going to items, items come to people ‚Äî a fundamental shift in warehouse logistics <a class="ref" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-robots-help-amazon-ship-packages-on-time" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>

  <p>To coordinate robot movements efficiently and avoid collisions in a fast-paced environment, Amazon designs the warehouse floor as a virtual graph. Using graph algorithms like A*, robots identify the most efficient route to their target destination. These decisions are not only calculated on-device but also augmented via real-time updates from AWS cloud services, which handle large-scale coordination, monitoring, and load balancing <a class="ref" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>

  <p>By combining robotics with cloud computing and graph theory, Amazon creates a warehouse ecosystem that is not only automated but also intelligent. This results in improved order accuracy, faster fulfillment, and significant cost reductions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
  <p>Amazon's warehouse navigation system is built around graph theory. The warehouse is modeled as a graph where every important location (like shelves, stations, or junctions) is a node, and the walkable paths between them are edges. This allows robots to calculate the best path between any two points on the floor.</p>

  <p>The <strong>A*</strong> algorithm plays a central role here. It is a pathfinding algorithm that combines the best parts of Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm (shortest path) and greedy search (goal-focused). By estimating how close a path is to the destination, it helps robots choose faster and more efficient routes in real time, especially when obstacles or other robots require route changes <a class="ref" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html" target="_blank">[3]</a>.</p>

  <p>Key data structures used include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Priority Queue:</strong> Selects the next most promising node quickly based on cost and distance.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> Efficiently stores which nodes are connected to each other, saving memory and speeding up lookup time.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Edge Weights:</strong> Allows path costs to change in real time based on conditions like blocked paths, traffic, or battery levels. This information comes from AWS IoT telemetry updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For instance, if multiple robots are approaching an intersection, the robot closest to it gets priority while others reroute or wait. These decisions happen in milliseconds, powered by local edge computing (Greengrass) and supported by the cloud.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h3>3. Architecture & Models</h3>
  <p>The system architecture integrates both edge and cloud computing. Robots operate independently for local decisions but remain connected to the cloud for global synchronization. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the system functions <a class="ref" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot-greengrass.html" target="_blank">[2]</a>:</p>
  <img src="images/casestudy4..png" alt="Funny animation" width="400">  
  <p>1. <strong>Robot Sensor:</strong> Each robot continuously collects data about its position, battery level, and surrounding environment.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>AWS IoT Core:</strong> Securely sends this telemetry data to the cloud, where it's processed and acted upon in real time.</p>
  <p>3. <strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Handles coordination logic ‚Äî such as reassigning paths, balancing traffic, or logging data.</p>
  <p>4. <strong>DynamoDB:</strong> Records telemetry and historical movement data for optimization, analytics, and debugging.</p>
  <p>5. <strong>AWS Greengrass:</strong> Runs the A* algorithm locally on robots so they don‚Äôt have to wait for cloud input, reducing latency in critical navigation decisions.</p>
